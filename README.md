# code_samples
The code samples from a few significant active projects are housed in this repository.
The sample files include:
 - Several API service files and vendor service files.
 - A few job files for sidekiq.
 - The controller and model files.

I apologise for not providing the test files on Rspec; but, I'm not confident enough to do so without the client's consent.

NOTE: 
 - Because I am unable to display the entire flow of codes for the client's project, I have selected a few random files to serve as examples.
 - Service files contain some codes that have been purposefully removed.

I appreciate your consideration.
